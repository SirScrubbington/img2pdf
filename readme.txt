# Instructions:

1. Install the latest stable version of the Python compiler (At time of writing, 3.7.0). Make sure to add Python to the system path when prompted!

2. Open a command line terminal window (cmd.exe) and type 'pip install -f ', then drag requirements.txt into the window and hit enter.

3. You're good to go! Drag any folder(s) which has files you want to convert into a .pdf into img2pdf.py, and it'll open a terminal window with a progress bar.

4. Contact me at damonmurdoch@gmail.com with any issues or suggestions. Thanks!
